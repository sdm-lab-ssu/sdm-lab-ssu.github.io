    NOTE(daniel): if we use the `home` layout, it will automatically write blog
    posts at the end. For now let's not do this but we might reconsider if we
    have stuff to write about.

<style>
  /* Adjust the page width just for this page alone. */
  .container-md {
    max-width: 1500px; /* Set your desired maximum width */
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }

  /* Add any other custom styles for the page */
  body {
    margin: 0; /* Set margin to 0 for the entire body */

The Sensing, Learning, and Understanding for Robotic Manipulation (SLURM) Lab at
the University of Southern California studies how we can enable robots to
interact with and manipulate geometrically and perceptually challenging objects.
Our long-term goal is to develop robots that can reliably manipulate objects in
less-structured and messier real world settings. To this end, we develop novel
methods for improving robotic manipulation by incorporating state of the art
machine learning algorithms, perception methods, and hardware platforms.
Professor Daniel Seita directs the SLURM Lab.

Why the name SLURM? :-) It's a reference to
<a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">the cluster management and job scheduling system</a>
used for Linux clusters. It is very helpful for many research labs!
