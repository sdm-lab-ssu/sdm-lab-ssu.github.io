- abs: Rearranging and manipulating highly deformable bags is common in daily
    life, such as when we put food in grocery bags or papers in backpacks or
    garbage in trash bags. In contrast to rigid object manipulation, manipulating
    deformable objects is challenging for robots due to complex object
    configurations and dynamics. Furthermore, the task of manipulating highly
    deformable bags introduces extra complexities due to reasoning about
    3-dimensional space. In this work, we consider a novel task of grasping and
    lifting physical bags to contain items. Using a bimanual ABB YuMi robot we
    test three grasping methods, where positions are determined via a human, a
    random baseline, and a baseline based on grasping the leftmost and rightmost
    points of the bag (``Maximum Width''). Across experiments where the YuMi
    grasps and lift bags to contain a fabric and a cable, we perform 15 trials for
    each method. Results demonstrate that the human has the best success rates
    (14/15), followed by Maximum Width (10/15) and then random (5/15).
