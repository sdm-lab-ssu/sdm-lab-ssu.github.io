    In recent studies, the policy-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have exhibited superior
    performance in addressing continuous control problems, such as machine arms control and robot gait learning.
    However, these algorithms frequently face challenges inherent in gradient descent-based weight optimization
    methods, including susceptibility to local optima, slow learning speeds due to saddle points, approximation
    errors, and suboptimal hyperparameters. This instability leads to significant performance discrepancies among
    agent instances trained under identical settings, which complicates the practical application of reinforcement
    learning. To address this, we propose a metaheuristic-based weight optimization framework designed to mitigate
    learning instability in DRL for continuous control tasks. The proposed framework introduces a two-phase
    optimization process, where an additional search phase using swarm intelligence algorithms is conducted at the
    end of the learning phase utilizing DRL. In numerical experiments, the proposed framework demonstrated superior
    and more stable performance compared to conventional DRL algorithms in robot locomotion tasks.

    While time series data are prevalent across diverse sectors, data labeling process still remains resource-intensive.
    This results in a scarcity of labeled data for deep learning, emphasizing the importance of semi-supervised learning
    techniques. Applying semi-supervised learning to time series data presents unique challenges due to its inherent temporal
    complexities. Efficient contrastive learning for time series requires specialized methods, particularly in the development
    of tailored data augmentation techniques. In this paper, we propose a single-step, semi-supervised contrastive learning
    framework named nearest neighbor contrastive learning for time series (NNCLR-TS). Specifically, the proposed framework
    incorporates a support set to store representations including their label information, enabling a pseudo-labeling of the
    unlabeled data based on nearby samples in the latent space. Moreover, our framework presents a novel data augmentation
    method, which selectively augments only the trend component of the data, effectively preserving their inherent periodic
    properties and facilitating effective training. For training, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that utilizes the
    nearest neighbors of augmented data for positive and negative representations. By employing our framework, we unlock the
    ability to attain high-quality embeddings and achieve remarkable performance in downstream classification tasks, tailored
    explicitly for time series. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches
    across various benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    As the demand for multi-chip products with high capacity and small size increases, semiconductor packaging 
    facilities have been faced with complicated constraints such as re-entrant flows, sequence dependent setups, and 
    alternative routes, which leads to difficulties in scheduling semiconductor manufacturing operations. Furthermore, 
    due to the frequent variations in the relative importance between objectives as well as the variabilities in initial 
    setup status, available machines, and production requirements, practitioners are obliged to obtain a schedule within 
    a short amount of computation time. In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase framework that aims to quickly produce 
    a schedule of semiconductor packaging facilities by using case-based reasoning for minimizing the weighted sum of 
    machine loss time and waiting time of jobs. Specifically, in the case generation phase, a case database is constructed 
    by solving case scheduling problems using an existing solver. The case reasoning phase is responsible for repairing 
    operation type sequences in the cases to produce a schedule for an unseen scheduling problem whose production 
    requirements, available machines, initial setup status, and weight between performance measures are different from those 
    of cases. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach requires a short computation time 
    similar to the rule-based methods while maintaining the quality of the schedules comparable to that of the existing metaheuristics.
