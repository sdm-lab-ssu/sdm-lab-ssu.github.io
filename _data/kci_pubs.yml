    Traffic congestion frequently occurs at multiple intersections with high vehicular traffic, particularly during rush hour.
    Inconsistent signal cycle lengths across intersections can hinder traffic flow, even when an upstream intersection grants
    a green light. To address this, the signal cycle lengths of multiple intersections should be identical. Furthermore,
    practical constraints must be considered- (1) all signal times must be integers, (2) phase sequences should remain fixed
    to prevent accidents and driver confusion, and (3) pedestrian safety must be ensured through sufficient crossing time.
    This paper proposes a novel particle swarm optimization-based method for optimizing traffic signals at multiple intersections,
    addressing the need for consistent signal cycle lengths and the practical constraints. The proposed method was evaluated
    using the traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). Compared to existing signals, the proposed method reduced
    the average waiting time of vehicles passing through multiple intersections by 10% during morning rush hour, 20% during
    normal hour, and 31% during evening rush hour.

    Although YOLO(You Only Look Once) is a widely used algorithm in real-time object detection, it has a limitation in 
    that its performance significantly deteriorates in occlusion areas where a detection target is obscured by another 
    object or surrounding background. In this study, we propose a robust object tracking framework that utilizes YOLOv5 
    and a Dual Kalman Filter(KF) consisting of Detection and Inference KFs to address this issue. The proposed framework
    uses the Detection KF updated with a high weight on the detection results of YOLOv5 when YOLOv5 fails to detect objects. 
    If the object is not detected over successive frames, the proposed framework attempts to track the object using the 
    Inference KF updated with a high weight on the prediction results of KF. Through experiments using data with occluded 
    regions, we confirmed that the proposed framework outperformed existing approaches in terms of detection accuracy 
    while sacrificing less computation speed.

    Recently, as COVID-19 has made the e-commerce market expand widely, customers who have different
    consumption patterns appear in the market. Because companies can obtain opinions and information
    of customers from reviews, they increasingly face the requirements of managing customer reviews on
    online platforms. In this study, we analyze customers and carry out market segmentation for classifying
    and defining types of customers in e-commerce. Specifically, K-means clustering was conducted on customer
    review data collected from Wemakeprice online shopping platform, which leads to the result that six clusters
    were derived. Finally, we define the characteristics of each cluster and propose a customer management plan.
    This study can be used as a reference to identify types of customers, reduce the cost of customer management,
    and increase profit for online platforms.
