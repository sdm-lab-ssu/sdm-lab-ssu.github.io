    As the demand for multi-chip products with high capacity and small size increases, semiconductor packaging 
    facilities have been faced with complicated constraints such as re-entrant flows, sequence dependent setups, and 
    alternative routes, which leads to difficulties in scheduling semiconductor manufacturing operations. Furthermore, 
    due to the frequent variations in the relative importance between objectives as well as the variabilities in initial 
    setup status, available machines, and production requirements, practitioners are obliged to obtain a schedule within 
    a short amount of computation time. In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase framework that aims to quickly produce 
    a schedule of semiconductor packaging facilities by using case-based reasoning for minimizing the weighted sum of 
    machine loss time and waiting time of jobs. Specifically, in the case generation phase, a case database is constructed 
    by solving case scheduling problems using an existing solver. The case reasoning phase is responsible for repairing 
    operation type sequences in the cases to produce a schedule for an unseen scheduling problem whose production 
    requirements, available machines, initial setup status, and weight between performance measures are different from those 
    of cases. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach requires a short computation time 
    similar to the rule-based methods while maintaining the quality of the schedules comparable to that of the existing metaheuristics.
